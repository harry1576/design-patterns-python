# SOLID

## Single Responsibility 
- A class should only have one reason to change
- Seperation of concerns (different classes handling different, independent tasks / problems)

## Open-Closed
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substituion 
- You should be able to substitue a base type for a subtype

## Inferface Segregation
- Don't put too much into an interface; split into sperate inferaces

## Dependency Inversion
- High level modules should not depend upon low level ones; use abstractions.
